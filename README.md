This is a simple code base containing two exercises for a 3 hour training session on basic unit testing (test-first
and other possibilities) using Junit and Mockito.

Since this is a Maven-based build there are a few extra steps needed to get it into Eclipse. These steps are nicely described
in [this blog post](http://www.mkyong.com/maven/how-to-convert-maven-java-project-to-support-eclipse-ide/)

Presentation (in Swedish) for the training session is also included.
